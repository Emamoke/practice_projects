             <h2>About Us</h2> 
             <p>EVE'S &amp; Spice Bakery is a family-owned business that has been providing quality baked goods for over 20 years. Our cakes, cupcakes, and desserts are made from scratch using only the finest ingredients. We specialize in custom cakes for weddings, birthdays, and other special occasions.</p>
              <br>
             <h2>Our History</h2> 
              <p>This business was founded in 2020 by Victory, who had a passion for baking and a desire to share her delicious creations with the world. Starting from a small home kitchen, the business quickly grew as word spread about the quality of our cakes and desserts. Over the years, we've expanded our offerings and moved into a larger commercial kitchen, but our commitment to quality and customer service has never wavered.</p> 
              <br>

               <p>Our team of expert bakers and decorators are passionate about creating beautiful and delicious cakes and desserts. We work closely with each customer to ensure that their cake is exactly what they imagined and that it tastes just as good as it looks.</p>
             <br>
               <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
             <p>At EVE'S &amp; Spice Bakery, we believe that baking is not just about making delicious treats, but about creating memories and celebrating life's special moments. We take pride in being a part of our customers' celebrations and making their days a little bit sweeter.</p>
